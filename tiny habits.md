The key takeaway from the talk is how small celebrations, like flossing one tooth, can motivate you to build better habits.A standout idea in the talk is how rewarding yourself for small actions can help establish lasting habits.

### 2. How can you apply the B = MAP approach to make forming new habits simpler? What do M, A, and P mean?

The B = MAP formula (Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt) is a helpful framework for building habits.

* Motivation (M): The driving force behind why you want to adopt the habit. Link the habit to something meaningful to you, or an objective you wish to achieve, to stay motivated.

* Ability (A): The ease of performing the habit. Simplify the habit so that it requires minimal effort to complete.

* Prompt (P): A cue to remind you to perform the habit. Use clear triggers that are associated with activities you already do, like your daily routine.
By making sure all three parts work together, forming new habits becomes easier.

To make a habit easier, eliminate obstacles that make it difficult to follow through. Arrange your environment to support your goal. For instance, if you aim to exercise, have your workout clothes ready and accessible. The simpler and more convenient you make the habit, the more likely you are to stick with it.

* Keep your cricket equipment (bat, ball, or gloves) in a visible place so you’re constantly reminded to play.

* Invite friends to join you or become part of a local club to make the game more enjoyable.

* Create a small practice area at home or nearby, making it easy to get started anytime.

* Monitor your progress, celebrate small milestones like reaching a specific number of runs, or simply savor the enjoyment the game brings.

### 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

Here my habit is eating junk food :
* Keep junk food out of your home or where you can’t easily see it.

* Think about how junk food harms your health to make it less tempting.

* Make it more difficult to access by not keeping it at home or limiting the places where you can get it easily.

* Link junk food to negative feelings to remind yourself why it’s not worth eating.
